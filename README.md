## Standalone sub-projects

This repository illustrates different concepts, patterns and examples via standalone sub-projects. Each sub-project is
completely independent of the others and do not depend on the root project. This _standalone sub-project constraint_
forces the sub-projects to be complete and maximizes the reader's chances of successfully running, understanding, and
re-using the code.

The sub-projects include:

### `notes/`

This is not an executable project but instead contains my notes about Rust.

See the README in [`notes/`](notes/).

### `guessing_game/`

Verbatim copy of the [*Programming a Guessing Game* chapter](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html).

See the README in [`guessing_game/`](guessing_game/).

### `read_file/`

A simple Rust program to read a file.  

See the README in [`read_file/`](read_file/).

### `json/`

A simple Rust program to deserialize and serialize JSON using the popular Rust JSON library called [*Serde*](https://github.com/serde-rs/json).

See the README in [`json/`](json/).

### `iterators/`

An illustration of Rust iterators.

See the README in [`iterators/`](iterators/).

## Wish list

General clean ups, TODOs and things I wish to implement for this project:

* Create an error handling sub-project
  * E.g. `Result/Ok/Err` and the `?` special thing
* Create an argument parsing sub-project
* Create an async sub-project
* Create a sub-project that shells out to another process
