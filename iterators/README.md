# iterators

A simple program that showcases "iterators" in Rust.


## Instructions

Build and run the example program with:

```shell
cargo run
```

Altogether, it should look something like the following.

```text 
$ cargo run
Compiling iterators v0.1.0 (/Users/davidgroomes/repos/personal/rust-playground/iterators)
Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.77s
Running `target/debug/iterators`

Showing different ways to iterate over elements.


Iterating using the 'for in' syntax...
Found message: 'Hello'
Found message: 'there,'
Found message: 'world!'

Iterating 'by hand'...
Found message: 'Hello'
Found message: 'there,'
Found message: 'world!'
```


## Wish list

General clean-ups, TODOs and things I wish to implement for this project:

* [ ] ABANDONED Create a custom iterator.
  * I abandoned this because I started reading the iterator code and hit a macro. No idea what's going on. I'll visit
    macros at a later date. There's so much unsafe code too in the iterator implementation. Related code snippets linked
    below.
  * <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/f2661cfe341f88bea919daf52a07015dceaf7a6a/library/core/src/slice/iter.rs#L134>
  * <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/f2661cfe341f88bea919daf52a07015dceaf7a6a/library/core/src/slice/iter/macros.rs#L41>
