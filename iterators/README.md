# iterators

A simple program that showcases "iterators" in Rust.

## Instructions

Follow these instructions to build and run the program:

1. Build and run:
   * `cargo run`
2. Altogether, it should look something like this:
    ```text
    $ cargo run
    Compiling iterators v0.1.0 (/Users/davidgroomes/repos/personal/rust-playground/iterators)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.77s
    Running `target/debug/iterators`
    
    Showing different ways to iterate over elements.
    
    
    Iterating using the 'for in' syntax...
    Found message: 'Hello'
    Found message: 'there,'
    Found message: 'world!'
    
    Iterating 'by hand'...
    Found message: 'Hello'
    Found message: 'there,'
    Found message: 'world!'
    ```

## Wish list
